## Overview
The Game Theory Simulator allows modeling interactions between agents in scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma.

**Goals:**
- Model strategic interactions programmatically
- Compare agent strategies and outcomes
- Visualize results clearly
- Encourage reproducible experiments


## Features
- Prisoner's Dilemma demo
- Round robin tournament
- Nine agent strategies:
Cooperate, defect, tit-for-tat, suspicious tit-for-tat, random, two tits for tat, gradual, & grim/permanent retaliation
- Extendable for new games or strategies
- Choose the Agents' strategies and the number of rounds played


## Usage for demo.py
- Make predictions
- Enter the strategy for each of the two agents
- Analyze the results

## Usage for tournament.py
- Predict which strategy will win for the number of rounds
- Enter the number of rounds the agents will play against each other
- Analyze the results



## Future work
- Add more strategies
- Statistical analysis tools
- Visualization -> first with 2d; possibly 3d later
- Web-based interactive version

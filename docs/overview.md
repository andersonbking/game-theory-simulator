# Overview

## Game Theory 
Game theory is the mathematical study of people making decisions that affect one another. The simulation utilizes the Prisoner's Dilemma version of Game Theory to illustrate how two self-interested individuals can create a worse outcome for both of them by failing to cooperate.

## Agents & Rounds

The simulation utilizes "agents" to display the results after each round. 
An agent represents a decision-maker that:

- Follows a defined strategy
- Observes past interactions
- Chooses an action each round based on its rules

The agents perform their defined strategy in each round of the simulation. The user can modify the number of rounds the simulation performs to analyze the different results. A total score, adding the combined scores of all of the rounds, is shown at the end.

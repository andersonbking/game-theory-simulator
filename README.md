## Overview
The Game Theory Simulator allows modeling interactions between agents in scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma

**Goals:**
- Model strategic interactions programmatically
- Compare agent strategies and outcomes
- Visualize results clearly
- Encourage reproducible experiments

---

## Features
- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Multiple agent strategies:
Cooperate, defect, tit-for-tat, suspicious tit-for-tat, random, & grim/permanent retaliation
- Extendable for new games or strategies
- Choose the Agents' strategies and the number of rounds played

---

## Usage
- Make predictions
- Enter the strategy for each of the two agents
- Analyze the results
- Learn from the data

---

## Future work
- Add more strategies
- Add more agents to the simulation
- Statistical analysis tools
- Visualization -> first with 2d; possibly 3d later
- Web-based interactive version
